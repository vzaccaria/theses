RISCV open source microprocessor enhancement
============================================

**Type**: *thesis/stage* c.o. STMicroelectronics, Agrate Brianza

**Description**:

This research project is configured with the following design activities

-   Evaluation of the RISCV microprocessor designed in the University of
    Berkeley, nowadays considered one of the most promising open
    source microprocessor.

-   Extension of its basic instruction set (ISA) with a new group of
    digital signal processing and computer vision instructions to
    address new emerging IOT radios and deep learning applications

The analysis of the new RISCV ISA will be performed at instruction
abstraction level, the Chisel language could be one of the adopted
solutions. The project can then be carried on in the hardware design
phase if the candidate owns adequate skills and motivations.

**Skills**: microprocessor architectures --- algorithms --- knowledge
for benchmarking --- RTL coding --- synthesis flow ---
